## About Me
The picture you see is a 3D printed copy of my brain from an MRI scan. This brain studies other brains. Here, it writes about brains.

I am a clinical data scientist in the [Sleep, Cognition and Neuropsychology](https://manoachlab.mgh.harvard.edu/) lab at [Massachusetts General Hospital](https://www.massgeneral.org/) and a postdoctoral research fellow at [Harvard Medical School](https://hms.harvard.edu/).

My expertise is in statistical and computational analysis of health-related data, with a focus on neuroimaging and electrophysiological signals in neuropsychiatric disorders. I create and maintain validated, reproducible analysis pipelines and develop advanced statistical methods to support translational research and biomarker discovery. You can read up on some of my methods development work in [anatomically guided MEG/EEG sleep spindle detection](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neurology/articles/10.3389/fneur.2022.871166/full) and [resolving source localization disagreement in resting-state networks](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S105381191930549X), or my work on [the relationship between cortical network disruption and cognitive impairment in multiple sclerosis](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/hbm.25247), how sleep spindles topography relates to memory encoding and consolidation, or [how hippocampal ripples facilitate wake offline learning](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-61136-y).

I received a PhD in Biomedical and Pharmaceutical Sciences at the [Université libre de Bruxelles](https://www.ulb.be/en/ulb-homepage) and hold a master's degree in Neuroscience and a bachelor's degree in Human Movement Science, both from the [Norwegian University of Science and Technology](https://www.ntnu.edu/).

## Recently

- Most learning on a motor task happens during the short periods of rest between trials (i.e. 'offline' learning). Do we also see higher hippocampal ripple rates during these periods? Do these hippocampal ripples correlate with the amount of offline learning? Spoiler alert! **[Our most recent paper was just published in Nature Communications](https://rdcu.be/euu5V)**
